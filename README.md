### Typing

The Interval SDK is written in TypeScript and should have rich type hints and inference. If you experience issues with IDE support, please ensure your editor is using the correct version of TypeScript that is installed in the workspace. If you are using Visual Studio Code, please try [using the workspace version of TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-the-workspace-version-of-typescript). Many editors should do this automatically.

If that doesn't help, please let us know! hello@interval.com
